**Governance** is one of the most discussed topics around PowerPlatform, and the key driver to a successfull use of low code in your organization.
But many conversations are missing the strategy and goals that underly this governance, going straight to technical discussions to implement tooling like the [CoE Starter Kit](https://github.com/microsoft/powerapps-tools/tree/master/Administration/CoEStarterKit)

The purpose of this framework is to help organizations envision their own low-code journey, by providing : 
* Field **insights** about what typical organizations are doing
   * [Chapter 1](https://github.com/Nicokirr/PPGovFramework/wiki/1.-Build-foundations) : Typical actions to build strong foundations
   * [Chapter 2](https://github.com/Nicokirr/PPGovFramework/wiki/2.-Typical-adoption-path) : Typical adoption path 
* A **structure** to organize your thoughts and make sure you address all key topics
   * [Chapter 3](https://github.com/Nicokirr/PPGovFramework/wiki/3.-Maturity-Scales) : An example of maturity Scale to help you set your goals (what is the step you are targeting)
   * [Chapter 4](https://github.com/Nicokirr/PPGovFramework/wiki/4.-Pilars-of-success): A detailed structure to identify recommended goals and associated actions to increase your low code maturity 
* Some **Tools** to buid your roadmap and regularly assess your progress.
   * [Chapter 5](https://github.com/Nicokirr/PPGovFramework/wiki/5.-Build-your-roadmap) : A proposition of maturity Scale to help you set your goals (what is the step you are targeting)
   * [Chapter 6](https://github.com/Nicokirr/PPGovFramework/wiki/6.-Maturity-Index) : A tool to precisely and regularly assess your low-code maturity
