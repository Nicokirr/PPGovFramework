# MAKERS ENABLEMENT

Makers enablement defines all touch points with makers (both citizen dev & pro dev), using content define by other pillars

| Theme | Activity | **Why** you should work on this activity | **How** you can start |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Training | Discovery training | Ensure **minimum knowledge baseline** across makers. Create a good start experience.| Provide regular & internal trainings on basic low code capabilities. (App in a day, Bot in a day, etc) |
| Training | Certification program | Generate **more valuable innovation** through increased awareness of platform capabilities | Build an internal certification program (skills and # of people). |
| Training | Multiple specialized training | Unlock citizen innovation on sensitive business data & processes | Build  specialized training capacity on key components of the business areas that are key to your digitalization strategy. These training should include our own guidelines based on your context (internal rules, regulations, etc) (ex:  Extending SAP with PowerPlatform) |
| HR | HR recognition program | **Recognize digital innovation** as key to your business success | Work with HR department to include LowCode as a managed skill, build gateways between field and IT positions |
| HR | Digital School | **Scale** internal training capacity | Work with HR department to deliver regular trainings and upskilling programs |
| Support | Self Service Support | Increase **discoverability** of key learning resources | Group all resources in one place (ex: SharePoint Site) to facilitate discovery of resources. Clearly document & communicate makers responsibilities to all stakeholders (makers, users, managers) |
| Support | Centralized makers support | **Professionalize** support for app makers, and directly support key applications | Have a central team that is included in global IT support processes, with several levels of expertise |
| Support | Decentralized makers support | **Scale** support based on local adoption | **Decentralized support teams** in divisions and subsidiaries. Local teams rely on a **local network of champions** that are usually not part of this team. Local teams can **escalate complex issues** to central team. (tools & processes in place) |
| Support | Ease **collaboration between makers** | Use **social networking tools** (Yammer, or equivalent) to create groups and content for makers. Automatically add new makers as members |
| Automation | Process automation (Basic - V1, Intermediate – V2, Advanced – V3) | **Right in time** communication. **Accelerate access to resources** requiring approval | Level 1 : Detect makers and automatically push “how to start” guide. Level 2 : Enable environment and DLP requests through online forms, approvals, and automatically perform actions based on approval.
Level 3 : To be defined |
