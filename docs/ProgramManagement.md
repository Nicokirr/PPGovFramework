Key items of a successful program management include : 
1.Culture :
2.Monitoring : 
3.Value Management: 
4.Policies : 

| Theme | Activity | WHY it matters | HOW you can start |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Culture | Culture | Create a culture adapted to IT democratization to maximize field innovation | Encourages evolutionary living systems (Death is part of evolution). Fail fast, “learn-it-all” culture, growth mindset. Executive sponsorship encourages digital innovation |
| Monitor | Usage Monitoring | Have **full knowledge** of all solutions built on Power Platform as well as creation and usage trends, to drive a **data driven strategy** | CoE Starter Kit Core is installed and provides **automated inventory** and **detailed usage statistics** of all low code items (apps, flows, bots, connectors, etc.), **regularly shared & reviewed** by Power Platform governance board.|
| Monitor | Detect Successful initiatives | Drive **innovation** through **field creativity**. | **Automated detection** of citizen solutions based on **usage frequency** and/or **number of users**. These detection criteria’s (thresholds & KPIs) are regularly reviewed and adjusted.|
| Show Value | App Catalog | **Inspire** citizen dev through examples. **Reduce duplication** (multiple apps on the same use case). **Increase adoption** of specific apps. | Citizen developers can **search & filter** apps in a “Store” to find relevant solutions based on business & tech criterias. The Power Platform governance board coordinates with businesses to **promote & scale app usage**, permanently and through campaigns, eventually leveraging std features “featured apps” & “hero apps”. A **process & checklist** are in place to define apps that are published in the store. Eventually, this includes an **application maturity** lifecycle that is used to plan promotion campaigns.|
| Show Value | Digital Catalog (not only apps) | Expand catalog to **other low code tools** | Expand catalog to other low code tools ( processes / workflows, bots, AI models, ...) |
| Show Value | Business Value monitoring | **Justify investments** based on R.O.I | Conduct Business Value Assessments to get an overview of the platform benefits. Have a process to collect R.O.I metrics from app makers. (Number of users impacted, time saved, impact on business budgets, etc) |
| Policies | Cost Management | Ensure **visibility of resources consumption** , aligned with costs planning (ie the right users consume the right resources). | Define the licensing & people costs and assign them to the right budget (Including internal billing policies, service offers). Build custom reporting to ensure resources consumptions aligns with these policies. Forecast evolution of consumption and adjust accordingly. (FinOps activities) |
| Policies | App Matrix responsability | Ensure **responsibilities are clearly established**  ahead of issues | Define a criticity scalen that can be based on usage & business impact. Make sure in the policies that each level of criticity correspond to specific responsibilities for users, makers, env admins, and platform admin team |
| Policies | Policies V1/V2/V3 | **Share best practices** with users & admin. **Enforce** critical policies. | Document **Makers policies** :  how users should work with lowcode, what is allowed and what is not (Must, should, could framework). Document environment **admins policies** : responsibilities, how to manage access, etc. Build automated process to track most critical policies. Regularly review policies to include key learnings. **Service Offers** from central IT to businesses (included maintenance service levels) |
